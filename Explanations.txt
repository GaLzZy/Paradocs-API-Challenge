[DISCLAIMER]
I have never used Spring Boot in my entire life. All I did in this project was roaming on the docs and learning on the spot how to use this framework.
It was also one of the few times I used Mongo.

[USED FRAMEWORK AND LANGUAGE]
I used Spring Boot with MongoDB and I wrote everything in Java.

[POSTMAN ROUTES]
All the routes are in the postman json file which you can import in Postman to test them

[HOW TO RUN IT]
So since I have never used Sprint before, I didn't know how to run it from IntelliJ, which I used to code this project. So I downloaded a tool called
Spring Tool Suite 4 which made it actually pretty easy to refresh the code I just wrote and start the program.

You'll need MongoDB installed on your machine and start Mongo server from the installation folder.

So from Spring Tool Suite 4, you would just import the project in there and then at the bottom where it says "local", you would expand this and
click on "paradocs-mongo-api..." and hit the red square and green play button. That's how I ran it.

[DIFFICULTIES]
So the main difficulty was that I never worked with Spring before. I spent some time in the documentations to learn how it works.
Probably that the way I made it has a couple problems or doesn't really follow the standards, but I gave it my best anyways from what I saw on the web.


So thank you Samuel and Tristan for your time and I hope this is not an absolute disaster...

Have a good day,
I hope we'll talk soon.

Gabriel.
